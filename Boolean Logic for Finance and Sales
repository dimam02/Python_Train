# Financial and Sales Logic Example

# Variables representing financial and sales conditions
revenue = 1000000  # Annual revenue in dollars
expenses = 800000  # Annual expenses in dollars
customers = 1000  # Number of customers

# Boolean expressions representing financial and sales conditions
profitable = revenue > expenses  # Is the company profitable?
high_revenue = revenue >= 1000000  # Is the revenue high?
high_expenses = expenses >= 800000  # Are the expenses high?
many_customers = customers > 1000  # Are there many customers?

# Complex boolean logic combining financial and sales conditions
if (profitable or high_revenue) and (high_expenses or many_customers):
    print("The company is performing well.")
else:
    print("The company needs to improve its performance.")
